## Project

This project is a React components library using TypeScript, Vite, Storybook, CSS Modules, ESLint, and with [Material Design Icons](https://material.io/resources/icons/) integrated. It is set up as a [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) project for efficient package management.

## Features

- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: Adds static typing to JavaScript, making the development process more robust.
- **Vite**: A fast, modern, and lightweight frontend build tool.
- **Storybook**: A development environment for UI components, allowing for interactive development, testing, and documentation.
- **CSS Modules**: Scoped and modular CSS to encapsulate styles within components.
- **ESLint**: A pluggable linting utility for JavaScript and TypeScript.
- **Material Design Icons**: A collection of delightful, beautifully crafted icons from Google. Copyright ¬© Google. [Material Design Icons License](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/blob/main/LICENSE).
